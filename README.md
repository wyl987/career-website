# Career Website

A dynamic career website that displays job listings from a cloud-hosted database and allows users to submit job applications directly to the database. This project showcases the use of various technologies to build a full-stack web application with a focus on both backend functionality and frontend design.

## Features
- **Dynamic Job Listings**: Job data is fetched from an AWS RDS cloud database and displayed dynamically on the website.
- **Job Application Submission**: Users can apply to job postings by submitting their information through a form, which is saved to the cloud database.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is styled using Bootstrap to ensure it works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Cloud Deployment**: The application is deployed on [Render](https://career-website-gdp4.onrender.com) for easy access and scalability.

## Skills and Technologies
- **Python Programming**: Backend logic, routing, and form handling.
- **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**: Frontend design and styling.
- **Flask**: Python-based web framework used to build the application.
- **Cloud Deployment (Render)**: Hosting the application in the cloud for public access.
- **Cloud Database (AWS RDS)**: Storing job and application data in a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM used for database interactions in Python, making it easier to handle SQL queries.
